# Harvey Orel
# Date: Oct 2022
# Description: Cleans alignments output from Yang and Smith: 
#					* By sample (removes samples with some % of missing sites across alignment) &
#					* By site (removes sites with some % of gaps across each site)
# Note: Input is a directory of fasta alignments. Output is to "trimmed_alignments" folder in launch directory;
#		1_trimmed_sample_alignments = trimmed sample alignments only
#		2_trimmed_site_alignments = alignments trimmed by sample and site
#
#       Arguments are: <input_alignment_directory> <sample_gap_threshold> <site_gap_threshold>
#
# Threshold values retain samples/sites that are BELOW the threshold value, i.e.
# "python3 target_capture_filter_alignments.py g/data/nm31/.../18_alignments_stripped_names_MO/ 0.5 0.5"
# retains samples with less than 50% of sites missing, and sites with less than 50% gaps.
